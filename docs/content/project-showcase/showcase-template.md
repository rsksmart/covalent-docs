## Docs Standard

There's no need to include this section. This is just for your reference. Delete this when submitting your PR.

### Bullet Lists

1. Bullets should start with `-` followed by a `space`: `dash` + `space`. For sublists, use a `tab` followed by `dash`

```
- List.
    - Sublist.
```

2. When a bullet list refers to some parameter definitions, use the following structure:

    - `Def` - This is a dummy definitition. 

```
Some text here:

 - `Def1` — some text here
 - `Def2` — some text here
```

3. You can use number to describe steps/

```
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
```

&nbsp;
### Images
1. Add images in `../images/you-image.png`. Either `png` or `svg` can be used.
2. Use the following structure to bring images in the your markdown file. 

```
![Image metadata](../images/your-image.png)
```

&nbsp;
### Tables

Tables can be used as well and can contain arbitrary Markdown code. As a reference, you can use this online [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). To create a table, you can use the following structure:

```
| Table       | Example                     |
| :---------: | :-------------------------: |
| `ONE`       |  Fetch resource  |
| `TWO`       |  Update resource |
| `Three `    |  Delete resource |
```

&nbsp;
### Content Tabs
In some cases, you might want to group alternative content under different tabs. For example, you are describing a code snippet in various languages. Content tabs allow you to wrap content in a single block. This block offers different tabs that will change the content depending on how you configure it. To do so, you can use the following structure:

```
=== "Option1"
    ```
    code snippet one
    ```

=== "Option2"
    ```
    code snippet two
    ```

=== "Option3"
    ```
    code snippet three
    ```

```

&nbsp;
### Notes
The notes option (!!! note) is super helpful when you want users to read some specific information. Notes can have custom titles with the following syntax `!!! note` “Your Title Here”. To do so, you can use the following structure:

```
Some text here.

!!! note
    This is a note. There is an empty line before the !!! note syntax, 
    and one right after this text. Note that this sentence will end with a dot.
    
Some text here
```
